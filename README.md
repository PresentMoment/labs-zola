# ZoLa (New York Cityâ€™s Zoning & Land Use Map)

ZoLa provides a simple way to research zoning regulations and other information relevant to planners. Find the zoning for your property, discover new proposals for your neighborhood, and learn where City Planning initiatives are happening throughout the City.

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
- [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)

## Local development

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-zola.git`
- Navigate to the repo: `cd labs-zola`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Run the development server: `ember serve`

## Connect to a local or remote Layers Api:
```
API_HOST=http://localhost:3000 ember serve
```
Note that you must provide `http://` to prevent cross-origin restrictions.

## Architecture

ZoLa is an [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/) single page application (SPA).  The frontend handles routing, web mapping, layout, and user interactions, and communicates with various APIs for content and data.

#### Layer-Groups

ZoLa retrieves layers from the [Labs Layers Api](https://github.com/nycplanning/labs-layers-api). It requests _layer groups_, which are groups of [MapboxGL layers](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/layers/). For example, the "subways" layer group includes the subway lines, subway routes, and subway station entrances layers. Each layer defines has style and some filter definitions. Alongside layers, the Layers API also delivers _sources_ which provide SQL definitions for the layers. One source may correspond to multiple layers. For example, a subways source powers the Subway A line, Subway J line and Subway G line, etc.

Most importantly, along with Layer Groups, the Layers API payload (in the metadata property) contains [a MapboxStyle object](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/root/), which provides [tile URL definitions](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/sources/) for all source layers. These tile url definitions are _anonymous maps_ generated by Layers API using the Carto Maps API.


#### Zola Search API 
Zola Search API provides autocomplete search results, and aggregates results from ZoLa's Carto database with those from the Mapzen Search API. The search API is an express.js app that lives in a separate repo: (https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-zola-search-api)

## BBL Route

 `https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/bbl/:bbl`

For convenience to other apps that work with NYC BBLs (10-digit Borough, Block, and Lot identifiers), a `/bbl` route is available for incoming links.  Incoming connections on this route will be redirected to the corresponding `lot` view.

Example BBL route

[https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/bbl/1000477501](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/bbl/1000477501)

will redirect to 

[https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/lot/1/47/7501](https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/lot/1/47/7501)

## Bounding Box Route

`https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/bbox/:west/:south/:east/:north`


For compliance with NYC [Local Law #40 of 2018](http://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/f6a21032-ecd2-4197-ba05-f415caa39ecf.pdf), the Department of Housing Preservation and Development is required to create a link to ZoLa for all NYC Urban Renewal Areas "that directs to the highest practicable zoom level that contains all blocks and lots within such urban renewal area".  The `/bbox` route allows for specifying a bounding box defined by WGS84 latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.  When the ZoLa application loads the `bbox` route with valid bounds, the map will automatically zoom to fit the supplied bounds into the user's viewport.

Example Bounding Box Route:

https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/bbox/-73.9978/40.5705/-73.9804/40.5785

## Testing and checks

- **ESLint** - We use ESLint with Airbnb's rules for JavaScript projects
  - Add an ESLint plugin to your text editor to highlight broken rules while you code
  - You can also run `eslint` at the command line with the `--fix` flag to automatically fix some errors.

- **Testing**
  - Run the test suite: `ember test -server`
  - Load `http://localhost:7357/` to view the test UI
  - Before creating a Pull Request, make sure your branch is updated with the latest `develop` and passes all tests

## Deployment

The App is deployed to our VPS using dokku, you need only do a `git push` of the master branch to the `dokku` remote.

- To create a new remote named `dokku`: `git remote add dokku dokku@{domain}:zola`
- To Deploy: `git push dokku master`
- To deploy a branch other than master, alias it to master: `git push dokku {branchname}:master`

## Contact us

You can find us on Twitter at [@nycplanninglabs](https://twitter.com/nycplanninglabs), or comment on issues and we'll follow up as soon as we can. If you'd like to send an email, use [labs_dl@planning.nyc.gov](mailto:labs_dl@planning.nyc.gov)

## Updating MapPLUTO Data

- **Indices** - When updating MapPLUTO data, be sure to add an index to the BBL column: `CREATE INDEX idx_mappluto_{version}_bbl ON mappluto_{version} (bbl)`

- **Block Centroids** - You also need to regenerate the `mappluto_block_centroids` data table that provides the centroid of each block. This is used to add block labels to the map. 
  - Run the `CREATE TABLE` SQL below on the Carto Batch UI: https://cartodb.github.io/carto-batch-ui/. 
  - Once the batch query runs successfully, you need to query for the table via the regular Carto UI and save it as a dataset.
  - Then you can run `DROP TABLE mappluto_block_centroids_new` to delete the invisible table saved on Carto's backend.

```
CREATE TABLE mappluto_block_centroids_new AS (
SELECT
  ST_Centroid(
    ST_Union(
      ST_makevalid(
        the_geom
      )
    )
  ) as the_geom,
  ST_transform(
    ST_centroid(
      ST_Union(
        ST_makevalid(
          the_geom
        )
      )
    ), 3857
  ) as the_geom_webmercator,
  block,
  borocode
FROM planninglabs.mappluto_VERSION
GROUP BY block, borocode)
```
